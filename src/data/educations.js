            "I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from Usha Mittal Institute of Technology in 2022.",
            "Throughout my studies, I gained proficiency in programming languages such as C++, Visual Basic, Java, Python, HTML, and CSS. My coursework included subjects like Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Object-Oriented Programming, Compilers, Time Complexity Analysis, and Data Warehousing, which provided a strong technical foundation.",
            "Beyond academics, I was actively involved in extracurricular activities. I served as a Class Representative during my first, third, and fourth years, developing leadership and communication skills while representing my peers. Additionally, I contributed to organizing Arcane Illusion, the largest cultural fest at our university, enhancing my teamwork and event management capabilities.",
            "I frequently participated in hackathons and coding competitions, winning several prizes that strengthened my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise. In my third year, I worked on a Drowsiness Detection project, applying machine learning techniques to identify driver fatigue. For my final semester project, I collaborated on Stock Market Prediction using machine learning models, and our work was later published with the guidance of Prof. Narendra Gawai.",
            "These experiences have equipped me with strong technical skills, leadership qualities, and a passion for continuous learning.",
